### Data Science Courses
In the era of IoT (Internet of Things), vast amounts of information are continuously generated worldwide. The ability to interpret this big data and solve societal challenges is indispensable in all future business fields. In the Data Science courses, I built on statistical analysis knowledge, utilized machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies, and acquired the knowledge and skills to analyze big data.
